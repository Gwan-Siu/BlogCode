    "Variational inference is an approximate technique, which is widely used in inference problem in modern statistic. As we all know, inferene problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quntities as a calculation about the posterior. In facr, posterior is usually intractable in modern Bayesian statistics. In order to sovle this kind of problem, Monte Carlo Markov Chain(MCMC) and variational inference are two main methods. MCMC is a technique of sampling, for example, Metropli-Hast algorithm and gibbs sampling, and variational inference(VI) turns inference into optimization problems. \n",

    "Suppose observed data $X$ and its latent variables $Z$, the prior of latent variables is $p(z)$ and the data likelihood is $p(x\\vert z)$, in many situation, we want to inference latent variables $Z$ through posterior $p(z\\vert x)$. In fact, the posterior is intractble due to the normalization term, where we have to integration over all latent variable $Z$. \n",
